You can transform the code snippet into a function by wrapping the code in a function definition. Here is an example of how you can do it:

import sqlite3

from main import path

def update_db():
    # connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(path)
    c = conn.cursor()

    # get the medicine name from user input
    medicine = input("Enter the name of the medicine: ")

    # get the number of pills to be removed from drug_container from user input
    num_pills_removed = int(
        input("Enter the number of pills to be removed from drug container: ")
    )

    # confirm with the user before updating the database
    confirmation = input(
        "Are you sure you want to remove {} pills from the drug container for {}? (y/n)".format(  # noqa: E501
            num_pills_removed, medicine
        )
    )
    if confirmation.lower() == "y":
        c.execute(
            "UPDATE user_drugs SET drug_container=drug_container-? WHERE medicine=?",  # noqa: E501
            (num_pills_removed, medicine),
        )
        conn.commit()
        print("Drug container for {} has been updated.".format(medicine))
    else:
        print("Drug container for {} was not updated.".format(medicine))

    conn.close()
