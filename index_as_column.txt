Yes, you can create a table with one of the columns as the name of your index that you'll set up with 'CREATE INDEX' later. 

Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    my_index_column TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table(my_index_column);
```

In this example, we create a table called `my_table` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `my_index_column`. We then create an index called `my_index` on the `my_index_column` column.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
